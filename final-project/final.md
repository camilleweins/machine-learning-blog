# Project Proposal

My goal was to use Posenet to detect my shoulder alignment. I was reading Dan Oved's post on Medium about Posenet and I was really interested in the article he mentioned about using neural nets to analyze gait. 

### Demo
* [demo]()
* [repo]()

### Technical Difficulties

I want to be able to replicate this from different angles such as the side.

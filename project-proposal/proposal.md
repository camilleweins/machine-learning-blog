# Project Proposal

I've been really interested in sashiko embroidery because of the simplicity and utility of the process. The patterns are comprised of simple, tiny running stitches and they follow very geometric or linear patterns. Ideally, I would like to turn any image into a pattern that could easily be replicated by my friend, who actually uses sashiko techniques to repair his jeans.

### Type of Model
I'm not sure what would work best. I think I can rule out Style Transfer. I'm thinking that a pix2pix model might work for this.

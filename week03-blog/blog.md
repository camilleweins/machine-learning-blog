# Week 3 - Style Transfer(Again)

I was thinking about training my own LSTM model but I couldn't find a good text example so I did another style transfer.

I followed this [tutorial](https://github.com/yining1023/styleTransfer_spell/)

No issues this time. The only disappointing thing is that my style doesn't look nearly as good as my first one.
